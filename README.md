# FizzBuzz
This Java program solves the FizzBuzz problem by printing numbers from 1 to 100. Instead of hardcoding specific numbers, it uses base numbers (e.g., 3, 5, etc.) and their corresponding words.
The program checks each number’s divisibility by these base numbers and prints the appropriate word or the number itself.

Key Points:
Uses a Map to store base numbers and their corresponding words.

Easily extendable: Adding new base numbers is simple—just update the Map.

Clean and scalable design, making the code maintainable and flexible for future changes.
